# hello-world
This is the hello world project from the tutorial.
My name is Stan Cason and I worked as a software developer for IBM for 36 years.
I retired in 2014 and have taken time to reboot and recharge.

I am now a web master for a website: gracepointvestal.com.
This runs on wordpress and uses several plugins that are developed on this site. 
I need to make a few changes and will be trying to help out on some of these plugins
if I can get my skills back.

We will see.
